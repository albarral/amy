*** HOW TO USE AMY

(updated: albarral 20/10/2017)

This document explains how to use amy to control a simulated UR5 arm.
For installation instructions refer to the "howto_install_AMY" document.

Environment requirements:
- 3 open terminals
- an open instance of Netbeans IDE

Components to be used:
- ur_gazebo  		(ROS package for UR5 simulator)
- ros_amy  	 	(ROS package to connect amy and arm)
- amy 			(process where the arm control is done)
- dady		  	(program to externally control amy and other robotic nodes from CLI)



*** LAUNCH ROS NODES ***

> Launch UR5 simulator in gazebo:

(terminal 1)
ws_amy>
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch ur_gazebo ur5.launch


> Launch ros_amyarm node (communication between amy & arm):

(terminal 2)
ws_amy>
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun ros_amy ros_amyarm



*** LAUNCH AMY ***

> Launch amy process:

(Netbeans)
run amy_main project




*** LAUNCH DADY (to control the arm from CLI) ***

The arm can be controlled from CLI with the dady program.

dady sends commands in talky language to amy or any robotic node.
(there's a command for ending the amy process remotely)
See howto_dady file in tron folder for installation instructions.

> Launch dady programm:

(terminal 3)
./dady arm joint pan*10
./dady arm joint tilt*60
...
./dady arm extra end*1
