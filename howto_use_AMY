*** HOW TO USE AMY

(last update: albarral 28/2/2017)

This document explains how to use amy to control a simulated UR5 arm.
For installation instructions refer to the "howto_install_AMY" document.

Environment requirements:
- 3 open terminals
- an open instance of Netbeans IDE

Components to be used:
- ur_gazebo  	(ROS package for UR5 simulator)
- ros_amy  	 	(ROS package to connect amy and arm)
- amy 			(process where the arm control is done)
- amy2		  	(program to externally control amy from CLI)



*** LAUNCH ROS NODES ***

> Launch UR5 simulator in gazebo:

(terminal 1)
ws_amy>
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch ur_gazebo ur5.launch


> Launch ros_amyarm node (communication between amy & arm):

(terminal 2)
ws_amy>
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun ros_amy ros_amyarm



*** LAUNCH AMY ***

> Launch amy process:

(Netbeans)
run amy_main project




*** CONTROL ARM FROM CLI ***

A user can control the arm by sending commands to amy from CLI.
He can also finish amy from same CLI.

> Send control commands:

(terminal 3)
~/amy/amy_console/dist/Debug/GNU-Linux> (or another place where we have a simbolic link to amy2)
./amy2 pan 50
./amy2 tilt 80
...
./amy2 end
